      I always wanted to be a writer. A writer of science, like Carl Sagan. At last, this is the only letter I am getting to write.<br><br>

      I loved science, stars, nature. But then I loved people without knowing that people have long since divorced from nature. Our love is constructed. Our beliefs coloured. Our originality valid through artificial art. It has become truly difficult to love without getting hurt.<br><br>

      The value of a man was reduced to his immediate identity and nearest possibility. To a vote. To a number. To a thing. Never man was treated as a mind. As a glorious thing made up of stardust. In every field, in studies, in streets, in politics and in dying and living.
